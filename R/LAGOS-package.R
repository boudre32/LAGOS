#' LAGOS Spatial Scale Metadata
#'
#' Data frames containing metadata for each spatial scale at which ecological context
#' data are derived in LAGOS. The spatial scales include 100m buffers (lakes4ha.buffer100m),
#' 500m buffers (lakes4ha.buffer500m), interlake watersheds (iws), hydrologic units (hu12, hu8,
#' hu4), ecological drainage units (edu), counties (county), and states (state). Each abbreviation
#' is the name of the data frame, with all or a subset of the following variables. For more information
#' about derivation of each spatial scale, see Details below or [insert supp docs] from Soranno et al. 2015.
#'
#' The nine LAGOS spatial scales were used to summarize the ecological context of each lake.
#' Ecological context themes include land use/land cover (LULC), connectivity (CONN), and
#' climate, hydrology, atmospheric deposition, and groundwater (CHAG). Not all themes
#' were derived at all scales due to scaling issues (e.g., scale of measurement larger than
#' size of zone). Briefly:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item iws: a dataframe with 51065 observations of 12 variables. The area of land
#'     that drains directly into a lake, and into all upstream-connected, permanent streams
#'     to that lake exclusive of any upstream lake watersheds for lakes â‰¥ 10 ha that are
#'     connected via permanent streams.  For details on how the watersheds were delineated,
#'     see additional file 8 in Soranno et al. (2015). Themes derived at the iws scale include
#'     LULC and CONN
#'     \item lakes4ha.buffer100m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables. Buffers are a
#'     100 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 100 m from the lake shoreline, calculated
#'     using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes derived at the 100m buffer scale include LULC.
#'     \item lakes4ha.buffer500m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables. Buffers are a
#'     500 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 500 m from the lake shoreline, calculated
#'     using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes derived at the 500m buffer scale include LULC and
#'     CONN.
#'     \item hu12: a dataframe with 20257 observations of 11 variables. The Watershed Boundary
#'     Dataset defines boundaries based on surface water drainage and creates nested Hydrologic
#'     Units (sometimes abbreviated and referred to as HUCs, which are hydrologic unit codes)
#'     that are georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 topographic base map. HUC12s are the sixth
#'     level of classificiation. HUC12s are defined along natural hydrologic breaks based
#'     on land surface and surface-water flow and they have a single flow outlet except in
#'     frontal, lake, braided-stream, or closed-basin hydrologic units. Themes derived at the
#'     HUC12 scale include LULC, CONN and CHAG.
#'     \item hu8: a data frame with 511 observations of 9 variables. HUC8s are the fourth
#'     level of classificiation. Sometimes called 'watersheds', a HUC8 is a geographic area
#'     representing part or all of a surface drainage basin, a combination of drainage
#'     basins, or a distinct hydrologic feature. Themes derived at the HUC8 scale include
#'     LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#'     \item hu4: a data frame with 65 observations of 9 variables. HUC4s are the second level
#'     of classification, called a 'subregion'. A subregion includes the area drained by a
#'     river system, a reach of a river and its tributaries in that reach, a closed basin(s),
#'     or a group of streams forming a coastal drainage area. Themes derived at the HUC4
#'     scale include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#'     \item edu: a data frame with 91 observations of 10 variables. Ecological drainage units
#'     (EDUs) follow the WBD boundaries, and are of roughly similar size to HUC6s.
#'     EDUs were delineated by grouping the HUC8 watersheds based on common zoogeographic
#'     history, and physiographic and climatic characteristics. Themes derived at the EDU
#'     scale include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#'     \item county: a data frame with 955 observations of 8 variables. Counties (political
#'     boundary) within the 17-state region of LAGOS. Themes derived at the county scale
#'     include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#'     \item state: a dataframe with 17 observations of 7 variables. Themes derived at the
#'     state scale include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#' }
